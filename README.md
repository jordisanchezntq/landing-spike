## Getting Started

First, need to copy and use a landing template.

1.  Git clone `git clone https://github.com/...`.
2.  Then run `npm install`.
3.  Finally use a development server to check all layout work in real time, using `npm run dev`. A server on port 3000 will be open, [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), check it with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
